## About The Packge

`poliprep` is an R package developed by the Polio data team at The World Health Organisation Regional Office for Africa ([WHO AFRO](https://www.afro.who.int/)). It is designed to assist users who have access to and work with datasets related to the [Global Polio Eradication Initiative](https://polioeradication.org/).

The package offers a number of functions for various tasks, including importing and exporting data, pulling data from relevant APIs, data processing and cleaning, as well as performing validations and checks.
