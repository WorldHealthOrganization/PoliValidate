\description{
This function takes the results of various data quality checks and creates a
unified summary table. It processes different types of checks including
overall data summary, coordinate checks, geographical mismatches,
geographical hierarchy, date checks, and date pair checks.
}
\details{
The function processes each type of check separately and then combines them
into a single table. It also renames and recodes some of the column names
and values for better readability.

# Assuming 'results' is the output from a data quality check function
# summary_table <- create_summary_table(results)
# print(summary_table)
